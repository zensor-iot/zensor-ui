# Active Context: Zensor Portal UI

## Current Work Focus

### Recent Major Changes
1. **Full Width Layout**: Updated CSS to use 100% width across all components
   - Removed `max-width: 1200px` constraints from main content, header, and components
   - Updated body and root element styles to use full width
   - Fixed conflicting styles from `index.css` that were limiting width

2. **Relay Control Enhancement**: Implemented comprehensive relay state management
   - Added "On"/"Off" display for relay values in both live messages and portal views
   - Implemented irrigation button safety controls (disabled when relay is active)
   - Added WebSocket-based irrigation completion detection
   - Enhanced button state management to wait for first WebSocket message

3. **WebSocket Integration**: Improved real-time data handling
   - Fixed Content Security Policy to allow WebSocket connections
   - Enhanced relay value display with visual indicators (green for "On", red for "Off")
   - Added Power icon for relay sensors
   - Implemented proper state synchronization between WebSocket data and UI
